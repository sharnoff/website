As I walked up towards the open space at the end, there was a cat sitting in\nthe middle of the circle.\n\nI got to the middle & it started walking over towards me - it seemed curious; ok with rubbing up\nagainst me, but not really in it for pets. I made my way over to the other side of the circle, and\nthe cat seemed to be ok with just sitting in the middle still; it even seemed to enjoy posing as I\ngot out my camera & took a few quick pictures.\n\nEventually, as the sunset meant the light was fading from the sky, this strange cat came over near\nme and started rolling around in some of the plants. By this time though, there wasn't much light to\nwork with, so after many attempted pictures of the cat sitting *just a couple feet from me*, I\nsettled for just two photos from the bunch.\n\nThis is a subset of the [\"Neighborhood Wander — Jul. 7 2021\"] album.\n\n[\"Neighborhood Wander — Jul. 7 2021\"]: /photos/album/wander-2021-07-06\n",
