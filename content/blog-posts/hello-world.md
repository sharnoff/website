Hey there! Welcome.

Who am I? My name is Max, but anything beyond that isn't too important -- identity is a funny thing.
At time of writing (Jan 2022), I'm an undergrad computer scientist at the University of Oxford,
originally from California.

In any case, this blog exists because enough people said I should -- and things like "that's a cool
idea! you should write a blog post about it!"

So that's really why this is here. To be fair, I had wanted a space to write for a while (doing a
computer science degree doesn't exactly afford many opportunities), and there _are_ some ideas I
want to get out into the world. This website actually was made so that I had a place to put blog
posts -- my photography just also happened to need a home.

Anyways, stay tuned! - You can find a list of planned posts [here](/blog/planned), but I'm making
no promises as to if or when I'll get around to writing them.

Most of the source for this site is [on Github](https://github.com/sharnoff/website).
